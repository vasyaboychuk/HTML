<p> The Simpsons is an American animated satirical series created by Matt Groening for Fox. The
    animated series is a
    satirical parody of the US middle-class lifestyle embodied in the Simpsons family, which
    consists of Homer, Marge,
    Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Most of the events take place in the fictional town of Springfield.
    The show satirizes many
    aspects of people's lives, American culture, society, even American television.</p>
